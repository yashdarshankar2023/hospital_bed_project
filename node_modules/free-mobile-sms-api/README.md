- 402 Too many requests sent, please wait few time
- 403 Access denied, check your credentials

## Disclaimer
This package doesn't use a complex queue mechanism for one reason, Free Mobile provide this feature for a fair usage, you're not supposed
to spam their API during the whole days with thousands queries.

For my own usage i rarely reach 50 SMS/day with some batches of 15-20 messages sent if few seconds, everything run smooth.
I never encountered a `402` error since 7 years I'm using it.
